<p> When you start the application, click on the button in the top menu
 "ApiPodaci". A form for adding an item will appear, clicking on the 
"Dodaj" button will add these item to the database. Clicking on the 
"Predmeti" button will appear 3 drobdown menus full of classes(entity in database) in the database.
 the subject view will display all the properties of the object. 
Clicking on the "obrisi" will delete the selected class.
 Clicking "Izmeni" will show the data in the form in which classes are added 
and edit the properties of the class by clicking the edit button. 
Clicking the "Studenti" button will show all students who are listening 
to the course.Database firts my approach. I used reposotory patern for aplication.
I used repository pattern,mysql database,database first approach.
